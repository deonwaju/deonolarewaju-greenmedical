# deon_greenmed

A new Flutter application.
An application that creates notifications as reminders for doctors appointments, also allows the patient to choose the type of doctor needed. 
The application has a log in page that leads the user to the welcome ui. where you can pick your doctor, set your notification reminders to remind the user about 
appointments with the doctor. 
It also has a covid statistics check area, emergency phone call, maps with direction to the hospital.

[NOTE]
The app is still under completion, I will still like to finish the notifications, covid api call and also write some tests.
